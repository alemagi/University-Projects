# \textcolor{blue}{GETTING STARTED WITH  \bf{R} and \bf{Markdown}.}

## \textcolor{blue}{We use \bf R}. 
**R** is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is the *lingua franca* for Statistics and Data Science, all over the world. 

Download **R**: <https://www.R-project.org> 

Look at the **manual**:"An introduction to **R**" (and many books) which come with the program 
<https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html>

## \textcolor{blue}{We use \bf RStudio} 
<https://rstudio.com>

## \textcolor{blue}{and \bf{R Markdown}}
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see \\ <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```
1.  Download and open RStudio. 
2.  From the menu, open a New File : choose R Markdown
3. You now have a file.Rmd, such as this one!
```
This is an R Markdown document. 
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars} 
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE,  out.width='50%'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that  `echo = FALSE` may be added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# R Markdown also interacts with **latex**

All scientific papers are written in **latex**. 

Don't worry if you are not familiar with it: at the end of this course, you will be an expert of **latex**, **R** and **R Markdown**!

# (1) Help files  & all that. 

## Using the HELP is crucial!

``` {r help}
help.search("time series")
```

```In Rstudio, use the menu in the panel on the right``` 

The package "stats" includes many functions for time series analysis. 

```Load package stats from the package menu```

```{r help2}
?stats
library(help=stats)
```

# Install new packages

Example: install and load the packages "sos", "dlm", "tseries".

The package "tseries" provides tools for time series analysis and computational finance. 

## In R studio, use the menu. Example: 
- install dlm
- load dlm (flag it)

## What is available in R for ...? 

- just google it.. 

- or RSiteSearch("dynamic linear models")

- or search at  http://cran.at.r-project.org    

- or use package "sos"

# (2) How to import data in **R**.

R provides several data sets, see e.g. 
```{r datasets}
?datasets 
```

## Importing data in R. 

You may want to set the working directory (menu on the top, choose Session, and Set Working Directory)

 Your own data should be contained in a file.txt. 
 For example, suppose you have a bivariate time series  (variables: x and y, say) in a file called mydata.txt

**To import the data in RStudio**, just use the menu on the top right panel!

(flag "headers yes"" if the headers (names of the variables) are written in your file; flag "no" otherwise.)

In **R**: 

- if mydata.txt includes the headers (names of the variables) 

``` # mydata <- read.table ("mydata.txt", header=T) ``` 

- if the headers are not included 

```# mydata <- read.table ('mydata.txt', header=F, col.names=c("x","y")) ```

(Be careful in choosing the names. For example, the name "data" exists already in R, and duplicating a name might cause issues.). 

# Access the data. 
Example: cars (in package datasets)
```{r data}
? cars
cars$speed
cars$dist
# or you can attach the data 
attach(cars)
speed
dist
detach(cars)
```

# (3) Time series objects. 

In R, you may have, or create,  **"time series" objects**. Example: 

```{r ts objetcs}
?ts 
?lh
str(lh)
is.ts(lh)  # check if lh is a time series object
# Another example: a monthly time series
? AirPassengers
str(AirPassengers)
AirPassengers
```

# How can I create a ts object?

```{r createTS}
#look at the help file!
?ts  
x <- round(rnorm(24), 2)   
# toy data: generate a sample (here of size 24) from a N(0, 4) distribution
y <- ts(x)
y
z <- ts(x, freq=12)
z
# did you see the difference between x, y and z?
rm(x,y,z)  # remove x, y, z
```

# (4) PLOTTING THE DATA: TIME PLOTS
```{r plots, out.width='50%'}
?AirPassengers  # the classical Box-Jenkins time series
plot(AirPassengers)

# For fancier plots, see the help file
?plot
# example 
plot(AirPassengers, type="o") 
plot(AirPassengers, type="o", pch=19, cex=.3)
```

A plot for looking at patterns of dependency between consecutive observations is $lag-plot$, in which you plot $y_t$ versus $y_(t-1)$
```{r lagPlot, out.width='50%'}
?LakeHuron
lag.plot(LakeHuron, do.lines=F)
# the dots tend to cluster around a straight line, which means that y_(t-1) is a good predictor of y_t. 

# This can be generalized to observations more than one lag apart
lag.plot(LakeHuron, lag=3, do.lines=F)
```

# Multiple time series
 How can I plot multiple time series? 

You can use plot or ts.plot.   

**Plot several time series on a common plot** 

```{r multipleTS}
?ts.plot
# example("ts.plot") 
# for running the examples of "ts.plot" - quite convenient!
```

**Look at these data**, monthly deaths from bronchitis, emphysema and asthma in the UK, 1974â€“1979. 
```{r ldeaths, out.width='50%'}
?ldeaths

# Plot the univariate series ldeaths
plot(ldeaths)  # or ts.plot(ldeaths)

# Plot the three series in a common graph
ts.plot(ldeaths, mdeaths, fdeaths)
# Nicer plots. Let me first remind these basics 
1:6  
c(1,2, 5, 67)
# Then try
ts.plot(ldeaths, mdeaths, fdeaths,lty=c(1:3))  # change lines type
# add labels
# ts.plot(ldeaths, mdeaths, fdeaths,lty=c(1:3), gpars=list(xlab="time", ylab="deaths"))

# You may also use "plot", for separate plots
deaths=cbind(ldeaths, mdeaths, fdeaths)  # put together the three columns
plot(deaths)

# For a comparison: 
# ts.plot(deaths, col=1:3)
```

# (5) TIME SERIES DECOMPOSITION

## \textcolor{blue}{Classical time series decomposition}: 
##  \textcolor{blue}{trend, seasonality, cicle, .., residual} 

$$ y_t = T_t + S_t + C_t + E_t   \quad  \mbox{additive} $$
$$ y_t = T_t * S_t * C_t * E_t   \quad \mbox{multiplicative} $$

\bigskip

**Is there any tool in R for time series decomposition?**

There are two main function for time series decomposition: 
 "decompose" and "stl"

```{r TSdecomposition}
?decompose
?stl
```

- **The function "decompose"** 
first smooths the series (i.e., determines the trend component) using a moving average, and removes it from the time series. Then, it estimates the seasonal factors from the de-trended series. Finally, the error component is determined by removing the trend and the seasonal figure. 

-  **The function "stl"** 
uses a more sophisticated smoothing technique (LOESS). See the references in the help file of stl. 

\bigskip

**We use "decompose"**

```{r decompose help}
# example("decompose") 
# for running the examples in the help file of "decompose"
```

Let's look at the data **co2**

```{r decompose, out.width='60%'}
?co2
plot(co2)
m <- decompose(co2)  # save the output as an object
names(m)
plot(m)

# We can choose an additive or multiplicative decomposition
# plot(decompose(co2, type="additive"))
```

**Exercize**: Describe the AirPassengers data. 

Compare the plots obtained by "decompose" and by "stl". 

```{r stl, out.width='60%'}
plot(decompose(log(AirPassengers)))
plot(stl(log(AirPassengers), s.window="periodic"))
```

# Removing trend and seasonality.

```{r airpassngers, out.width='50%'}
plot(AirPassengers)
# Is this series stationary? 
# Make a logarithm transformation for stabilizing the variance
lap=log(AirPassengers)
plot(lap)
# We may try the first order differences to make the series approximately stationary (in mean and variance)
plot(diff(lap))
# This may remove the trend, but not the seasonality. 
# A 12 lag difference might be used for removing the trend and the seasonality
# plot(diff(lap, lag=12))
```

**Remark: Did you succeed in removing trend and seasonality?** What is unsatisfactory? You will explore more on this data in your **Assignment 1**.

**Another example**
```{r BJsales}
?BJsales
```

# (6) Exponential smoothing

## Is there any **R** function for exponential smoothing and Holt Winters? 

```{r HW}
help.search("Holt Winters")
# Look at the examples in 
?HoltWinters
```

## Simple exponential smoothing

This is a classical dataset
```{r Nile, out.width='60%'}
?Nile
plot(Nile)
```

The series shows no clear trend nor seasonal behavior. We can use simple exponential smoothing. 

```{r Nile ses, out.width='60%'}
HWNile <- HoltWinters(Nile, beta=F, gamma=F)
plot(HWNile)
# What is the value of the smoothing parameter? 
HWNile

HWNile$alpha
```

## Look at the effect of the smoothing parameter:

```{r Nile alpha, out.width='60%'}
par(mfrow=c(2,1), cex=.4)
plot(HWNile, main="Nile data: simple exponential smoothing, alpha=0.24")
#cex.main=1.5 # if you want to control the title font.  
HWNile2 <- HoltWinters(Nile, alpha=.9, beta=F, gamma=F)
plot(HWNile2, main="Nile data: simple exponential smoothing, alpha=0.9")
```

## Holt \& Winters: including trend and seasonality.

```{r seasonalHW, out.width='60%'}
out <- HoltWinters(AirPassengers, seasonal = "mult")
plot(out)
plot(fitted(out))
```

# (7) Contributed packages. Financial time series. 

**Contributed packages can be dowloaded and installed 
    authomatically from CRAN!**

**Examples** 

- package *"tseries"* (Time Series Analysis and Computational Finance) 

- package *"quantmod"* (Quantitative Financial Modelling Framework)

- package **dlm** (MLE and Bayesian analysis of Dynamic Linear Models), originally developed for this course. 

**Exploring around...**

- From the menu, *install* the package "tseries" (if not there yet), and *load* it.  

In the help, open the **vignette** for package "forecast" (**Journal of Statistical Software** paper)

- Install and load package "quantmod", and explore it.
